# Cross Validation Techniques – LOOCV & LPOCV

This repository contains a hands-on implementation of **cross-validation techniques** used in Machine Learning, specifically:

- Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)
- Leave P Out Cross Validation (LPOCV)

The project is implemented using **Python** and **Scikit-Learn** to clearly demonstrate how these techniques work internally.


##  Project Overview

Cross-validation is an important method to evaluate machine learning models and avoid overfitting.  
This notebook explains LOOCV and LPOCV by generating train-test splits and analyzing their behavior on sample datasets.

##  Concepts Covered

- Cross Validation basics  
- Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)  
- Leave P Out Cross Validation (LPOCV)  
- Train and test split indices  
- Number of combinations generated in LPOCV  


##  Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-Learn
